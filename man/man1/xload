NAME
       xload - system load average display for X

SYNOPSIS
       xload [-toolkitoption  ...] [-scale integer] [-update sec-
       onds] [-hl color] [-highlight color]
	     [-jumpscroll  pixels]  [-label  string]   [-nolabel]
       [-lights]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xload  program  displays a periodically updating his-
       togram of the system load average.

OPTIONS
       Xload accepts all of the standard X Toolkit  command  line
       options	(see X(1)).  The order of the options in unimpor-
       tant.   xload  also  accepts  the   following   additional
       options:


       -hl color or -highlight color
	       This  option  specifies	the  color  of	the scale
	       lines.

       -jumpscroll number of pixels
	       The number of pixels to shift  the  graph  to  the
	       left  when the graph reaches the right edge of the
	       window.	The default value is 1/2 the width of the
	       current	window.	Smooth scrolling can be achieved
	       by setting it to 1.

       -label string
	       The string to put into the label	above	the  load
	       average.

       -nolabel
	       If  this	command line option is specified then no
	       label will be displayed above the load graph.

       -lights When specified, this option causes xload	to  dis-
	       play  the  current  load average by using the key-
	       board leds; for a load average of n, xload  lights
	       the  first n keyboard leds.  This option turns off
	       the usual screen display.

       -scale integer
	       This option specifies the minimum number	of  tick
	       marks  in the histogram, where one division repre-
	       sents one load average point.  If  the  load  goes
	       above  this  number,  xload will create more divi-
	       sions, but it will never use fewer than this  num-
	       ber.  The default is 1.

       -update seconds
	       This  option  specifies the interval in seconds at
	       which xload  updates  its  display.   The  minimum
	       amount  of  time allowed between updates is 1 sec-
	       ond.  The default is 10.

RESOURCES
       In addition to the resources available to each of the wid-
       gets  used  by  xload there is one resource defined by the
       application itself.

       showLabel (class Boolean)
	       If False then no label will be displayed.

WIDGETS
       In order to specify resources, it is useful  to	know  the
       hierarchy  of  the  widgets  which  compose xload.  In the
       notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical  struc-
       ture.   The  widget class name is given first, followed by
       the widget instance name.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get the default host and display number.

       XENVIRONMENT
	       to get the name of a resource file that	overrides
	       the  global  resources stored in the RESOURCE_MAN-
	       AGER property.

FILES
       <XRoot>/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLoad  -  specifies	required
       resources

BUGS
       This  program  requires	the  ability to open and read the
       special system file /dev/kmem.  Sites that  do  not  allow
       general	access	to  this file should make xload belong to
       the same group as /dev/kmem and turn on the set	group  id
       permission flag.

       Reading	/dev/kmem is inherently non-portable.  Therefore,
       the routine used to read it (get_load.c) must be ported to
       each new operating system.
